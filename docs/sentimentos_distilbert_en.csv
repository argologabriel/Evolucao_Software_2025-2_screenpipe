1766,feat(testing): add e2e test for windows and linux,"Hey @louis030195 — yep, you got it!

Here’s a plain-English breakdown of what the E2E test setup actually does:

* Sets up the environment to build a release version.
* Installs `tauri-driver` to automate the app during tests.
* Grabs the right version of Edge WebDriver to drive the app's built-in browser.
* Runs the test suite using WebdriverIO

  * The main test opens the app, skips onboarding, closes the changelogs popup, clicks the health icon, and checks that the app shows ""screenpipe is running smoothly.""

* While the tests run, a script (`record.js`) kicks off ffmpeg to record the desktop.

 * Starts recording at the beginning, stops at the end, and saves the video.

* Uploads the screen recording and test logs as artifacts to GitHub Actions.
* Also uploads the `.screenpipe` folder (which might have logs, DB files, or mp4s the app made during the test).


So yep — your understanding is spot on: the test is recorded, and the video gets uploaded for review!

- If the ffmpeg binary is not downloaded on external bin then it will download and copy to screenpipe environment.
- If it is present, then it will copy to screenpipe environment.

Also, an important note...  went back into the vm and did a ""which ffmpeg"" again, still nothing on PATH.. but figured I should maybe double check to see if there is a binary in `~/.local/bin/` like I've seen previously.

indeed there is an ffmpeg (that's been downloaded?) there...

It should be be bundled into the screenpipe binary as of this pr, right? 

Do you also have a standalone ffmpeg binary in `~/.local/bin/` as well?

the ffmpeg you're seeing in `~/.local/bin` is downloaded by ffmpeg sidecar, which isn't supposed to do.

yeah so i tihkn the rust ffmpeg install should display a progress bar or something 

and in the UI like onboarding or when we run start_screenpipe we should check the log if there is some form of loading (eg downloading model, ffmpeg, migration, etc. it should parse properly and display a UX feedback on the UI like a progress bar, spinner, something, and maybe write a message like ""downloading model, ffmpeg whatever""",NEGATIVE,0.9976363182067871
