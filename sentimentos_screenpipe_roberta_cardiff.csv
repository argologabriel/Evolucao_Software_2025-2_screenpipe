1766,feat(testing): add e2e test for windows and linux,"Hey @louis030195 — yep, you got it!

Here’s a plain-English breakdown of what the E2E test setup actually does:

* Sets up the environment to build a release version.
* Installs `tauri-driver` to automate the app during tests.
* Grabs the right version of Edge WebDriver to drive the app's built-in browser.
* Runs the test suite using WebdriverIO

  * The main test opens the app, skips onboarding, closes the changelogs popup, clicks the health icon, and checks that the app shows ""screenpipe is running smoothly.""

* While the tests run, a script (`record.js`) kicks off ffmpeg to record the desktop.

 * Starts recording at the beginning, stops at the end, and saves the video.

* Uploads the screen recording and test logs as artifacts to GitHub Actions.
* Also uploads the `.screenpipe` folder (which might have logs, DB files, or mp4s the app made during the test).


So yep — your understanding is spot on: the test is recorded, and the video gets uploaded for review!
